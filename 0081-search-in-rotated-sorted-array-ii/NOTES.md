â€‹Here's a step-by-step explanation of the search method in the given class:

Initialize two pointers, left and right, to mark the range of the array to be searched. Initially, left is set to 0 (the start of the array), and right is set to nums.length - 1 (the end of the array).

Enter a while loop that continues as long as the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer. This loop will perform the binary search and gradually narrow down the search range.

Calculate the middle index, mid, as the average of left and right. This is done to examine the value at the midpoint of the current search range.

Check if the value at the midpoint (nums[mid]) is equal to the target value. If it is, return true because the target has been found in the array.

Handle the case where there are duplicate values at the start (nums[left]) and end (nums[right]) of the current search range. If nums[mid] is equal to both nums[left] and nums[right], increment left and decrement right to skip over the duplicates. This step ensures that the search range is reduced.

If the array segment from left to mid is non-decreasing (i.e., nums[mid] >= nums[left]), check if the target value falls within this segment. If the target is within this range, update right to mid - 1 to continue the search in this segment; otherwise, update left to mid + 1 to search in the other segment.

If the array segment from left to mid is not non-decreasing (i.e., nums[mid] < nums[left]), check if the target value falls within the segment from mid to right. If the target is within this range, update left to mid + 1 to continue the search in this segment; otherwise, update right to mid - 1 to search in the other segment.

If the loop completes without finding the target value, return false to indicate that the target is not present in the array.

This algorithm takes advantage of the rotated sorted array property to efficiently narrow down the search range in each iteration, leading to a time complexity of O(log N), where N is the size of the input array.
